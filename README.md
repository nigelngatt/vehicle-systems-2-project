# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
A repository for the courses E0009E and Building AI. Learning how to combine both AI and programming to make new things happen.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
Since the problems started long time ago I merely touch on the surface now since I don't want to get to nestled into the problems which are way too intricate. I only resolve the basics and try to give users a new outcome by using several sources which are both free and open source. Easy to use and work with. Updatable and managable.

* Integrate data
* Display it

## How is it used?

The process involves using different sources of information.
Not only reusing information and data but also making them look good together.
That takes time and effort. Since the web is infinite, it takes all the time you have to find solutions.
When it is finally put together, the result resembles a product that most users find interesting. If you like smartphones, laptops or computers you 
will feel comfy. In this project I create a solution for an automobile (a car), where the driver looks at the stats of the car while driving.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
The majority of the data stems from the web. Anything that is open source is reused. I also add data from my own sources.

## Challenges
It could use more freedom of control. Less recycling code and more code written from scratch.

## What next?
More education and knowledge in new frameworks. Probably a better developer. Less error-detection and more problerm-solving.
