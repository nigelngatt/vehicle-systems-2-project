    <h1 class="xxl">Description</h1>
    <h4>Who is this guy?</h4>
    <p>
      Who? Me?
      I'm Navid, or Nigel as I am called nowadays. 34 yoa and still beating the blocks.
      During this course, I hopped on to add some more skillsets to my repertoir.
      Despite the downsides of covid, I kept pushing and finally I had my idea at heart.
      The course itself put it in vanilla too. But I also understood that it is quite flexible.
      It gives you space to do something you want too.<button type="submit"><a href="team.php">Keep reading</a></button>

    <h1 class="xxl">Idea</h1>
    <h4>Evolutioning</h4>
    <p>
      From the start, we only knew we wanted to work with other people.
      Then, we narrowed it down to working with financial services.
      Again, we narrowed it down to a particular field in finance that handles
      the entrance of d.e. (digital electronics), and that's where eijch comes in.

  <h1 class="xxl">Goals</h1>
  <h4>The expected future</h4>
  <p>
    The future is always near. Just around the corner even. You just need to stop trying to beat the clock and you'll get past it.
    In the later stages of the course, I hope to be able to actually implement the codecs into a real world project and not just an emulator.

  <h1 class="xxl">When it'd started</h1>
  <h4>Ripe from the gecko</h4>
  <p>
    It started when founder (Nigel) was a little boy, he had his dreams and intentions were spoken.
    Then, at the age of 21 things became evident. Hopped on an educational institution along with extra-curriculars and years later the company came alive

  <h1 class="xxl">Does it come with a manual</h1>
  <h4>Think inside the box</h4>
  <p>
    There's no actual manual, but you can ask our staff and the response should be equivalently usable.

<div class="col-3 row-2">
  <h1 class="xxl">Does it help</h1>
  <h4>Can we help you?</h4>
  <p>
    The short answer is yes.
    If you're looking for an intricate answer, then keep researching.
    We alone won't be able to solve your problems, since its' up to you,
    but we direct you where you should go.
